        <h1>An Introduction to this class</h1>
        <p style="background-color:#8B8611; width:1300px">In this course, we will attempt to create webistes that will be super presentable
        to our peers. In addition, this is a basic language that nearly all beginners learn,
        so it is absolutely necessary that we learn HTML first. Plus, it will teach basic programming
        skills and habits for later on!</p>

        <h2>Our Schedule</h2>
        <!-- As the heading number gets higher, the font gets smaller-->
        <p>This will be what we will be doing for the next 3 months!</p>
        <ul> <!-- ul stands for UNordered list, so just bullets-->
            <li style="color:gray">October: Website Design with HTML</li>

        <h3>Our Rules</h3>
        <p>Here are a set of rules so everyone has fun coding!</p>
        <ol> <!-- ol stands for UNordered list, so there are numbers-->
            <li>When the teacher is talking, <a style="color:green">no talking</a></li>
            <li>If you have a question, ask the teacher</li>
            <li>If you are done with the activity, tell the teacher</li>
            <li>Help each other! Don't make fun of each of another for not getting something; we all
            learn at different paces!</li>
            <li>Try to come to every session</li>
            <li>Think before you code</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>

(generated by <a href="https://www.poem-generator.org.uk/">this poem generator</a>)

There once was a young man called paul.
He said, "See the lovely pitfall!"
It was rather little,
But not quite cockpit hill
He just couldn't say no to the caul.
