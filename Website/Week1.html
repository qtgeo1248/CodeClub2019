        <h1>An Introduction to this class</h1>
        <p>In this course, we will attempt to create webistes that will be super presentable
        to our peers. In addition, this is a basic language that nearly all beginners learn,
        so it is absolutely necessary that we learn HTML first. Plus, it will teach basic programming
        skills and habits for later on!</p>

        <h2>Our Schedule</h2>
        <!-- As the heading number gets higher, the font gets smaller-->
        <p>This will be what we will be doing for the next 3 months!</p>
        <ul> <!-- ul stands for UNordered list, so just bullets-->
            <li>2/4 - 3/10: Website Design with HTML and Javascript</li>
            <li>3/17 - 4/24: Game Design using Python</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Rules</h3>
        <p>Here are a set of rules so everyone has fun coding!</p>
        <ol> <!-- ol stands for UNordered list, so there are numbers-->
            <li>When the teacher is talking, no talking</li>
            <li>If you have a question, ask the teacher</li>
            <li>If you are done with the activity, tell the teacher</li>
            <li>Help each other! Don't make fun of each of another for not getting something; we all
            learn at different paces!</li>
            <li>Try to come to every session</li>
            <li>Think before you code</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
        </ol>
